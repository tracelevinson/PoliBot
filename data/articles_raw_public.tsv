Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning All shades of opinion have called for greater government clarity about Brexit but not everyone is pleased at being told that the UK will definitely leave the customs union.   The Guardian describes the decision as a door which has been ""slammed firmly shut."" The Sun argues that ""no reasonable interpretation of Brexit could keep us tied to Brussels' rules and handicap a new independent trade policy.""    But the Daily Mirror fears the prospect of ""job-destroying trade barriers with our biggest markets"". Elsewhere, the Daily Telegraph says it has obtained a leaked report by civil servants which suggests that Britain may have to accept 37 new EU directives in the transition period that will follow Brexit.   During that time, says the paper, the UK would be ""powerless to stop"" but would have to obey rules ranging from recycling and insurance for mobility scooters, to the operations of the City of London and the use of fertilisers. The Times points out that scientific studies are rarely able to demonstrate a direct link between the movies and the behaviour of people who watch them.   But, apparently, researchers in the US have done just that - demonstrating that the release of the ""hugely successful"" Fast and Furious films resulted in faster driving by people stopped for speeding.   About the same number broke the law but there was a clear increase in the average speed of offenders.  The man behind the research tells the paper he really likes the films but watches them at home.

The report claimed Sir Bradley Wiggins and Team Sky ""crossed an ethical line"" by using drugs allowed under anti-doping rules to enhance performance, instead of just for medical need. The Sun's front page calls the findings a ""bombshell"".  Meanwhile, Matt Dickinson from the Times says Team Sky's general manager Sir Dave Brailsford has offered no contrition beyond a grudging acknowledgement of poor medical record-keeping. ""If it was only ever about winning at all costs, Sir Dave Brailsford might fool himself that he can ride out the damage from a devastating report into Team Sky,"" he says. He says he should resign.  The Daily Mail says thawing water pipes that have burst are causing havoc across the country.  A number of schools can't open because they have no water and 13 million people in London and southern England have been told to ration, or risk having no water at all.  The paper quotes one customer, who accuses his water supplier of diverting funds meant for repairs into fat cats' pockets.  The Daily Express reports that millions of people are facing poverty in retirement because they failed to take tax advice before drawing down their pension pot.  It says the Treasury is pocketing a £5bn windfall from taxes paid by unsuspecting savers, who didn't know that only the first 25% of cash taken out of a pension fund is tax-free.  A government spokesman tells the paper that giving people the freedom to cash out is the right thing to do - and points readers to its free pensions advice service.

There was, as the Daily Express says, global astonishment at the announcement of a summit between President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.   As the Sun reminds its readers, the pair had traded insults for more than a year.  Yet quite suddenly - the Times reports - there appears to be the possibility of rapprochement between the two.   For the i newspaper, the meeting will be an extraordinary moment of geopolitical theatre that could lead to breakthrough or prove to be a gross blunder. Has Mr Trump pulled off the biggest diplomatic coup by a US President since Richard Nixon's visit with Chairman Mao? the Daily Mirror asks. So what prompted Little Rocket Man to offer his invitation, and why did the Dotard take it, the Korea Times in South Korea wonders - references there to the insults the US and North Korean leaders have traded against each other.  The Financial Times says Mr Trump is betting he can end Washington's record of failure in dealing with Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions over a quarter of a century. The police investigation into the attempted murders of the former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, continues to get extensive coverage. Several papers report that the nerve agent used to poison them may have been concealed in a package.   According to the Daily Telegraph, counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Miss Skripal inadvertently brought a gift for her father from Moscow, planted by Russian intelligence in her baggage.  The Mirror says the package would have released the chemical in Mr Skripal's home at a set time.

However, the results of Donald Trump's recent medical check-up have sparked an online conspiracy theory - the girther movement.  According to the official medical report, released by the White House on 16 January, President Trump stands at 75 inches (6ft 3in; 1.9m) and weighs 239lb (17st 1lb; 108kg).  But the girther movement, propelled mainly by critics of the president, posits that Mr Trump is shorter and heavier than the report suggests.  This particular presidential physical has received increased interest after questions were raised over Mr Trump's mental health and supposed unhealthy diet.   There have been more than 56,000 tweets about the girther movement since late on 16 January, with one of the first tweets to use the term posted by political commentator Chris Hayes.  One of the most popular girther tweets claims to show a photograph of Mr Trump's driving licence listing the president as 6ft 2in (74in; 1.88m), an inch shorter than reported by the White House physician.  An image of his driving licence appeared in a 2016 article on news website Politico.  A number of social media users posted photos of Mr Trump standing next to well-known figures in a bid to compare their heights.  Others have been sharing photographs of professional athletes with a similar height and weight to the president, pointing out the disparity in their appearance.  However, many have highlighted that muscle is heavier than fat, which may make comparisons unfair.  Others online have questioned the independence of the doctor overseeing the medical examination. Dr Ronny L Jackson is the current Physician to the President  and oversaw two of former President Obama's medical examinations.  Dr Jackson said in a press conference that Mr Trump has ""incredible genes"" and if he had a healthier diet over past 20 years ""he might live to be 200"".  Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn used the #girther hashtag to offer to donate $100,000 (£72,470) to charity if the president agreed to be re-weighed by a different doctor.   While much of the discussion online was sceptical of the claims made in the president's medical report, some defended Mr Trump and slammed the girther movement.  Referring to previous calls for the president to release his tax returns, one twitter user questioned if Mr Trump's critics would ever be satisfied with the evidence produced by the current administration. Some suggested the girther movement was hypocritical for fat-shaming the president.  And former director of the US Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub Jr, asked whether people should be making jibes about President Trump's physical attributes. The term girther is an apparent nod to the well-established ""birther' movement"", made up mainly of right-wing activists who opposed President Obama, with Mr Trump as its most public face.  Birthers questioned the former president's place of birth and his eligibility to hold high office. It has been widely derided as a racist conspiracy. The birther theory was pushed hard by Mr Trump, and resulted in Mr Obama releasing his birth certificate to the public in 2011.  #Girther A post shared by  CFOX (@cfoxvan) on Mar 4, 2016 at 4:17pm PST End of Instagram post  by cfoxvan"
4	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-42959655	bbc	"BBC Trending. US President Donald Trump has been the victim of a fake tweet which went viral overnight.  The tweet, which suggested the sitting president should be ""shot into the sun"" from a cannon should the ""Dow Joans"" drop significantly, was posted minutes after US stocks suffered their worst fall for more than six years on Monday. Since he took office in January 2017, President Trump has tweeted a number of times about the increasing value of US stock markets, highlighting the gains as evidence of economic improvement under his presidency. However, social media users often look through Trump's previous tweets to find statements and claims he made in the past which contradict his current stance.  There is even a Reddit index called r/TrumpCriticizesTrump where users flag up old Trump tweets and post inconsistencies. So when British author Shaun Usher posted a screenshot of what looked like a tweet from the president on Monday, using Trump's characteristic style and dated from February 2015, it did not take long to generate interest. Almost 20,000 people retweeted Usher and 41,000 have liked his tweet in 14 hours. It, and his string of tweets in response have generated tens of thousands of comments. Fifteen minutes after his initial post, Usher expressed his surprise that many people thought the tweet was ""genuine"". Ten minutes after that, he realised his tweet had gone ""everywhere"" and later  described the situation as ""wild"". Usher said the Washington Post and fact-checking site Snopes have been in touch with him to discuss the tweet. You might like this: Many people are criticising Usher for sharing his fake tweet, but he said the tweet went beyond his control and deleting it ""felt wrong"". While others are saying the tweet is ""fake,"" and that Usher has added to the confusion around ""fake news"". However, some appreciated the point they believe Usher's tweet was trying to prove. Twitter user @NovelBookworm said: ""The best part is how easily we all believe that Trump said something stupid a couple years ago."" ""All those bizarre and true Trump tweets are (mostly) still up,"" posted @creaturemonster. The BBC has contacted Usher for comment."

Six years after Donald Trump tweeted his views on video game violence, it seems he is looking to take action. In a White House briefing following the Florida school shooting, when press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about the president's policy on gun control she said Donald Trump will ""be meeting with members of the video game industry to see what they can do on that front"". Ms Sanders response has been widely discussed on social media, with some criticising the president for pointing the finger at fictional guns, rather than actual firearms. You may also like: Some people wondered if they had inadvertently stumbled into the past, as the relationship between video games and violent behaviour has long been debated in the media. One person asked why the White House was discussing video games, saying that Trump ""has plenty of ideas for ending mass shootings, except gun control"". While artist and director Rob Sheridan, known for his work with music group Nine Inch Nails, wondered if game industry executives might suggest similar measures. This was followed by Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane pointing out that ""other countries without America's gun problem also have video games"". And one person tried to find the funny side of things, re-writing Australia's 1996 gun ban for comic effect.  But some people praised Trump for taking action, with one person saying the president is ""doing more and engaging more than Obama did"", and another applauding Trump for addressing the ""surrounding issues"" of guns. Meanwhile, Twitter users have begun to question exactly who it is that Donald Trump intends on meeting.  Video game journalist Jason Schreier tweeted that the Entertainment Software Association, whose members include many of the largest game publishers in the United States, says neither the ESA nor its members have been invited to a meeting. And if a meeting does happen, one person wondered how the meeting could go ahead without causing contention."
6	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42628142	bbc	"Trump surprises with Davos decision. Donald Trump plans to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos - the first sitting US president to attend the annual gathering in almost two decades. The Swiss mountain village conference attracts some of the richest and most powerful people in the world and has become a byword for the global business interests Mr Trump often attacks. This year's theme: creating a shared future in a fractured world, appears to clash with Trump's populist rhetoric.  Davos takes place in late January. More than 2,500 people are expected at this year's conference, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mrs May were among the biggest names that attended last year.  It is unusual for a US president to attend the Swiss retreat. While Ronald Reagan joined the Davos crowd several times, it was only via video link.  The first sitting US president to appear in Davos was Bill Clinton in 2000, at the forum's 30th anniversary session. He has been a regular attendee in most years since.  President George Bush - father and son - never came to the village in the Swiss mountains, and President Barack Obama also never appeared at the conference. Analysis: Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor Davos? Davos! It is the ultimate schmoozefest of the elite; shameless speed dating for the ruling class. It is where central bankers and global CEOs rub shoulders with presidents, prime-ministers and royalty.  Oh, and there's normally a smattering of Hollywood A-listers pushing this or that concern. In my times there I've seen Bono, Claudia Schiffer, Matt Damon etc, etc.  To put it another way, it's about as un-Donald Trump as you can get, and about as far away from his base as you can imagine. Last year it was dismissed out of hand that he would go for precisely those reasons. So why the change of mind?  Well one year in, the president has a story of economic success to tell, as the US continues to grow, tax cuts are in place and the stock market is soaring.  It also comes a year after President Xi won rave reviews for his appearance at The World Economic Forum, to give it its proper name.  Maybe in the great tussle with China over trade, Mr Trump wants to win back some of that lustre for the US. And maybe he will enjoy giving a poke in the eye to all those globalists as he sets out the case for America First.  One of my colleagues suggested the rather American metaphor ""as welcome as a skunk at a garden party"".  I have no idea what she means. As ever though, it will be quite something to behold. Turning up at Davos is perhaps especially surprising for President Trump, who has made go-it-alone policies a hallmark of his administration. His spokeswoman said he would promote policies to strengthen ""American businesses, American industries, and American workers"". Analysts said attending Davos may be a way for President Trump to respond to criticism that he is ceding America's position as a world power, even as China seeks to take the stage. ""I see this as consistent with the adults in the administration saying, here is a way to help you stand up against Xi and... assert some kind of American engagement with the rest of the world,"" said Professor Charles Stevenson, who teaches American foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ""I see it as a positive but surprising step that gives him an opportunity if he does it right."" Founded in 1971, the World Economic Forum promotes international trade, among other initiatives. In contrast, Mr Trump has deployed anti-immigrant rhetoric, opposed multi-lateral free trade agreements, criticised institutions such as the United Nations and backed out of global treaties such as the Paris Agreement on climate change. President Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon has often derided the ""party of Davos"" - a term he uses to describe a global moneyed class that does not support national or working class interests.  President Trump recently broke with Mr Bannon, who was quoted in a new book describing a meeting between the president's son and a group of Russians as ""treasonous"". ""If Steve Bannon were still there and had influence, this would not happen, but Trump's not ideological,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm.  Mr Bremmer said the trip will satisfy the president's craving for headlines and is unlikely to draw the attention of his base. But he added that participating carries risks, since the president is unlikely to mix well with the posh crowd, and risks an embarrassment if he goes off-script. ""In terms of what Trump can actually accomplish, he's not going to change any minds by going to Davos,"" Mr Bremmer said. ""Even if it went perfectly, there's not much upside."" "

8	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42803041	bbc	"Davos 2018: Europe seeks attention before Trump arrival. The snowploughs here at Davos do a very good - if loud - job. They scoop up the drifts - often feet deep - and deposit their icy loads in the ever-attendant snow lorries which follow behind. The political equivalent of the biggest snowplough here in the Alps arrives at the World Economic Forum tomorrow. US President Donald Trump will helicopter in and is likely to drive all before him. Delegates are certainly waiting with bated breath to hear the message the president will deliver in his keynote address on Friday. And during the huge business reception the White House is planning tomorrow evening. An invite to that will certainly confer WEF bragging rights. Yesterday, the president said his key point would be a clear one: ""it's time to invest in America."" His policies are working and the economy is booming, he will say. Whether he will offer a more conciliatory tone on global trade - yesterday, America announced new, protectionist tariff barriers on the import of solar panels and washing machines - is open to question. Before the plough arrives from Washington, Europe is seeking to have its one day in the limelight. And their message will be very different from the president's. Emmanuel Macron of France, Angela Merkel of Germany and Paolo Gentiloni of Italy will all talk up globalisation, free trade and the need for multilateral approaches to the world's economic problems. Only by working together and not in isolation will the world prosper, they will argue. The leaders of Greece, Sweden and Poland are also here today - Europe day for the World Economic Forum. In their support for globalisation, they have firm backers in the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and the Canadian leader, Justin Trudeau, who both spoke yesterday. The divide between the ""globalists"" and the ""protectionists"" is one of the big dividing lines here in the mountains. The other is between ""the rock stars"" and ""the rest"" - those leaders that all the business and political leaders want to meet, and those that are simply not creating so much energy. President Trump will certainly garner a huge amount of interest, both from supporters and detractors. The level of fascination is even more intense than that generated by President Xi Jinping of China, who came here last year. The other ""rock star"" of 2018 is certainly Mr Macron. Last week, he hosted business leaders at Versailles ahead of his visit here. All of those who went, and it included the biggest names in the corporate world, have spoken here of how impressed they were - and are - by the French leader's efforts both to woo them and to reform the French economy. If mood music were a GDP indicator, Mr Macron would be shooting out the lights. Tomorrow, on the day Mr Trump and his sizeable entourage arrive (the president is bringing 13 ministers and senior officials), Theresa May will give her address here in Davos. Its tone will be fascinating. On which side of the divide, globalisation versus protectionism, will she sit? And, as the great and the good of politics crane their necks to glimpse the leaders of America and France, how will the British prime minister combat the sense among some here that the UK now makes its bed with ""the rest"" rather than ""the rock stars""?"
9	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42812453	bbc	"Are President Trump's tax cuts helping workers?. It is bonus season in America - and this year, companies are cutting some workers special cheques. At Disney, 125,000 workers will receive a $1,000 one-time bonus. Alaska Airlines said 23,000 of its staff would get $1,000 awards, on top of their usual incentive system. And about 60,000 employees at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are due to take home $2,000 extra. Those companies are just three of the roughly 250 firms that have announced bonuses, pay increases, more generous benefits or US investments, citing tax cuts the US passed in December, according to Americans for Tax Reform, an organisation that lobbies for lower taxes. All told, the group counts at least 3 million Americans due for some kind of boost from employers as a result of the overhaul, which slashed the corporate rate from 35% to 21%. The announcements have reignited debate over whether the controversial law - estimated to cost a total of $1.5tn from 2018 through 2027 - is good for the average American. On its face, the new law provides relatively minimal benefit for households.  The cuts for families are estimated to amount to an average of just $1,600 in 2018 - a difference of less than $31 per week. And most of the benefits will accrue to the wealthiest families. The White House has seized on the company announcements as proof the law offers other benefits to workers. As President Donald Trump put it in a recent Twitter post: ""Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. ""Now Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!"" Opponents of the overhaul have dismissed the announcements as little more than publicity stunts, pointing to billions more going to share buybacks and dividends - and in some cases, layoffs at the very companies promoting the awards. Telecommunications giant AT&T, for example, was among the first to announce its plans: $1,000 bonuses for more than 200,000 workers and $1bn in extra US investment in 2018. But the company - which is trying to win government approval to purchase Time Warner -  is also negotiating with union workers over roughly 1,000 layoffs.  Similar elements of spin and redundancies have coloured other announcements. On the same day that Walmart announced plans to increase its minimum pay to $11 and offer bonuses of up to $1,000, word emerged that the firm was closing 63 of its Sam's Club stores and laying off thousands of workers. Apple, after touting a five-year $350bn contribution to the US economy, acknowledged that much of the money reflected its current spending pace. And the firm - which politicians have criticised for years for its overseas cash pile and offshore manufacturing - had already committed nearly as much - $300bn - to buy back shares and boost dividends.  In the broader context, the benefits for workers are ""trivial"", says Beth Allen, spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, the labour union that represents staff at AT&T and other companies. ""Our workers at AT&T in particular, because the layoffs happened at the same time, saw it for what it was - which was something the company was doing to get to the press,"" she said. Analysts say companies have reasons outside of the tax bill to be re-thinking worker benefits. The US unemployment rate is now hovering around 4.1% - a level last seen in 2000 - putting pressure on firms to keep workers happy. But it is also clear that self-promotion and political calculus are driving some of the announcements. ""Why didn't they just tell their workers privately?"" says Laurence Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University, who described some of the announcements as ""implicit back-scratching"" for the White House. ""They're making a big deal of this to serve some other purpose, maybe getting the country to like their product or getting the government to lay off a bit."" Banks represent more than a third of the companies with announcements on the Americans for Tax Reform list. That sector is among the biggest beneficiaries of the tax changes, and also expects lighter regulations. Many companies, however, were already paying below the 35% headline rate. Professor Kotlikoff says that suggests firms are making their decisions due to sentiment - not policy changes. Those moods can shift quickly, he warns. The White House maintains the optimism will translate into expansion and investments, hiring, and, ultimately, higher wages, as firms compete for workers. That would be a welcome change for the US after years of relatively stagnant wage growth. John Bremen, who advises companies on human capital and benefits as a managing director for Willis Towers Watson, says there are signs that is starting to happen. His firm surveyed more than 300 companies, and found that roughly two-thirds were considering improving benefit packages or had already taken action as a result of the law. Many firms were already looking at ways to retain and attract workers due to the tight labour market, but the tax law ""amplifies it and accelerates it,"" he says. Economists predict the tax cuts will boost the US - and global - economy, albeit modestly, by spurring consumer spending and investment. This week, the IMF revised up its global growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points, citing the overhaul. In the US, the Tax Policy Center says tax cuts are likely to lift the economy by 0.8% in 2018, but the effects will fade over the decade.  As departing Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said when asked about the effect of the tax cuts last month: ""Much uncertainty remains."" The same could be said for the American worker."
10	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42833765	bbc	"Donald Trump came to Davos with a mission to reassure. Few people knew what to expect.  Would this be belligerent Trump - wagging his finger at the global elite about how divorced they were from reality, from what people really want? Or would this be conciliatory Trump, setting a different tone? We heard the second. The president touched many of the World Economic Forum's erogenous zones. But many were not quite sure how to take it considering the pit bull they were expecting. He talked about the voices of the forgotten - a constant theme here among the ""super-haves"" who are coming to a creeping realisation that the system has to change if faith in the capitalist system is to endure. He talked about economic success being about more than the sum of production, it was about the ""sum of its citizens"". Businesses, he argued, had to remember their obligations to the people who worked for them. Critics will pick at the easy holes. For example, on those income tax cuts it's the wealthy who will gain more. And the business tax cuts are far larger than those for middle-income Americans. Mr Trump said that America First did not mean America Alone. It was the key line of the speech. And it was a message echoed by other leading members of the White House power pack here, including Gary Cohn, the president's chief economic adviser and head of the US National Economic Council. This is all about trade and the US approach. The fear was that America under Mr Trump would throw up a series of trade barriers, increasing protectionism at a time when most government leaders at Davos - Narendra Modi of India, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Emmanuel Macron of France - were preaching the gospel of globalisation. But today we heard a more nuanced manifesto. America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade. Which may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week following the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines. Mr Trump's argument is this: The rules of the free trade world were built after the Second World War when America's economic interests were rooted in the successful development of other countries' economies. These countries then became eager customers for American products. That equation has changed. China is a much more powerful economy. The Asian emerging markets, South America and Europe all now have much more muscular dogs in the fight for global trade. Mr Trump said state planning, intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies were the new weapons of trade wars - and used against America. ""Fair and reciprocal trade"" is the new US mantra. And if the administration feels it does not receive such treatment, the president will act - for example, by passing an executive order pulling the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation Asian trade deal. It's a message that has not fallen on stony ground here. ""I don't think it's inappropriate that we re-look at some of the treaties that were so asymmetric,"" Larry Fink, the chief executive of investment company BlackRock, told me. ""Some of these countries now are very strong and very developed. It's going to be a long game. ""The world is benefitting by global trade and we need to find ways of creating more global trade to benefit more humanity worldwide,"" he said. America is still a trading nation, one which gains far more economically from globalisation - world trade - than it does from protectionist measures. And that brute economic truth means that Mr Trump has to play a different tune here - to the business leaders and investors who decide where to place their cash - than maybe to the left-behind voters of the US rust belt. So the president said that America was ready to do bilateral deals that would be ""mutually beneficial"". He even suggested a re-engagement with the TPP. On trade, this was Trump 2.0. The politics might have been angry in the past, but today, economic reality softened the president."
